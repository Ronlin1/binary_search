Binary Search Algorithm Vs Naive Search 

This is basically an searching algorithm of a sorted list that proves that binary search is better than naive search or line by line.
In the code we use two important modules of random and time with a generated random list to show the timing analysis.

Please excuse the multiple comments and code that were used for unit testings.

Hope You Enjoy it!
